## Description

This repository contains a test project which focuses on demonstrating a modal window with form. Key aspects of this modal include:

- **Centered Modal Window**: Designed to appear in the center of the screen.
- **Close Functionality**: Users can close the modal either by clicking on a cross icon or by pressing the escape key.
- **Form with Input Validation**:
  - **Email Field**: Validates if the input is a valid email address.
  - **Question Field**: A textarea with validation for text length being greater than zero and less than 150 characters.
- **Simulated Request on Submission**:
  - Upon clicking the "Send" button, a fake request is initiated with a 1-second delay.
  - The request has a 50/50 chance to either succeed or fail.
- **Feedback on Request Outcome**:
  - Displays a success message if the request is successful.
  - Shows an error message with an option to retry if the request fails.
